Website Features for Holistic Healthcare Monitoring
1) Advanced Symptoms Checker
How It Works: 
- Users select symptoms from a comprehensive list of checkboxes.  
- The system utilizes AI to analyze the selected symptoms and identify potential health risks.  

Output:
- A categorized list of possible diseases:  
  - High-risk diseases: Require immediate attention or further medical investigation.  
  - Moderate-risk diseases: Conditions that may require monitoring or lifestyle adjustments.  

Impact:
- Empowers users to recognize early warning signs of serious health conditions.  
- Encourages timely medical consultations and proactive health management.

2) Lipid Profile Analyzer  
How It Works:
- Users input key cholesterol values, such as LDL, HDL, Total Cholesterol, and Triglycerides.  
The system applies medical thresholds and AI algorithms to evaluate the lipid profile.  

Output:  
- Detailed risk assessment: Categorized as low, moderate, or high risk.  
- Detection of potential conditions, such as cardiovascular disease or metabolic syndrome.  
- Personalized recommendations, including dietary advice, exercise plans, and the need for medical consultation.  
Impact:  
- Simplifies complex lipid test results, making them easy to understand for users.  
Promotes preventive care and reduces the risk of long-term complications. 

3) Health Chatbot  
How It Works:  
- A 24/7 conversational AI assistant that addresses general health-related queries.  
- Designed to provide users with reliable, AI-powered responses on a variety of topics, such as symptoms, preventive measures, and healthy habits.  

Features:  
- Instant and user-friendly support for non-critical health concerns.  
- Access to verified health tips, lifestyle advice, and disease-related information.

4) Disease Predictor (Completed but will be integrating with Website later)
The Disease Predictor leverages machine learning algorithms to provide health insights based on user-input symptoms.

Input Mechanism:
Users select up to five symptoms from a comprehensive dropdown menu covering a wide range of common health indicators.

Processing Framework:
The system employs three powerful machine learning algorithms:
Random Forest: Combines multiple decision trees to provide robust and accurate predictions, handling complex relationships between symptoms and diseases.
Naive Bayes: Utilizes probability-based reasoning to deliver quick and reliable classifications, particularly effective for high-dimensional symptom data.
Decision Tree: Provides an intuitive, hierarchical approach to identify potential diseases based on symptom patterns.

This predictor module aims to bridge the gap between initial symptom identification and professional diagnosis, fostering early detection and proactive health management.
